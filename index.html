      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        According to PEW Research, 96% of adults between 18–29 occasionally consult reviews
        before making a purchase. But does this mean that higher ratings result in more product
        sales? Specifically, what do higher ratings indicate for video game sales? Maybe higher
        ratings lead to more game sales. But could some more obscure games with a dedicated group
        of followers receive higher ratings than popular games with significant sales volume? I am
        also curious whether there has been an increase in the production of games in recent years
        and, if so, what affect this increase has on the quality of games based on review scores.
        Is it possible that an increase in the number of games results in review scores decreasing
        with the oversaturation of video game releases?

        In this project, I plan to use Metacritic’s user and critic review scores to see if there
        is a correlation between the scores of a game and its overall sales. I will be joining the
        review data with sales data obtained from VGChartz.
